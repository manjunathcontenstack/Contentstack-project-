EdgeStack – Static Site (Contentstack-inspired)
================================================

This is a dependency-free, static website inspired by the structure and visual style of the referenced pages on contentstack.com. It uses original copy and placeholder assets.

Run locally
----------
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
- Serve the folder with any static server.

Pages
-----
- `index.html` – Landing page with header, hero, roles section and footer
- `blog.html` – Blog listing (placeholder)
- `careers.html` – Careers (placeholder)
- `contact.html` – Contact form (client-side only)

Notes
-----
- All branding and text are placeholders; replace with your own.
- Global design tokens and gradients live in `assets/styles.css`.
- Minimal JavaScript in `assets/script.js` handles mobile nav and dropdown.
